### Getting Started

The `kamon-http4s` module brings traces and metrics to your [http4s][4] based applications.

Kamon <b>kamon-http4s</b> is currently available for Scala 2.11 and 2.12.

Supported releases and dependencies are shown below.

| kamon-http4s  | status | jdk  | scala | http4s            
|:------:|:------:|:----:|--------------:|-------
|  1.0.1 | stable | 1.8+ | 2.11, 2.12 | 0.18.x

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt`
file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.kamon" %% "kamon-http4s" % "1.0.1"
```

## Metrics and Tracing for http4s in 2 steps

### The Server

```scala
def serve[F[_]](implicit Effect: Effect[F], EC: ExecutionContext) : Stream[F, StreamApp.ExitCode] =
    for {
      _ <- Stream.eval(Sync[F].delay(println("Starting Google Service with Client")))
      client <- Http1Client.stream[F]()
      service = GoogleService.service[F](middleware.client.KamonSupport(client)) (1)
      exitCode <- BlazeBuilder[F]
        .bindHttp(Config.server.port, Config.server.interface)
        .mountService(middleware.server.KamonSupport(service)) (2)
        .serve
    } yield exitCode
```

* __(1)__: The Kamon [Middleware][5] for the `Client` side.
* __(2)__: The Kamon [Middleware][6] for the `Server` side.

### The Service

```scala
object GoogleService {
  def service[F[_]: Effect](c: Client[F]): HttpService[F] = {
    val dsl = new Http4sDsl[F]{}
    import dsl._

    HttpService[F] {
      case GET -> Root / "call-google" =>
        Ok(c.expect[String]("https://www.google.com.ar"))
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 1: Add the Kamon Libraries
```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-core" % "1.0.1",
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-system-metrics" % "1.0.1",
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-prometheus" % "1.0.0",
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-http4s" % "1.0.1",
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-zipkin" % "1.0.1",
  "io.kamon" %% "kamon-jaeger" % "1.0.1"
)
```

### Step 2: Start Reporting your Data

The last step in the process: start reporting your data! You can register as many reporters as you want by using the
`Kamon.addReporter(...)` function:

```scala
Kamon.addReporter(new PrometheusReporter())
Kamon.addReporter(new ZipkinReporter())
Kamon.addReporter(new Jaeger())
```

Now you can simply `sbt run` the application and after a few seconds you will get the Prometheus metrics
exposed on <http://localhost:9095/> and message traces sent to Zipkin! The default configuration publishes the Prometheus
endpoint on port 9095 and assumes that you have a Zipkin instance running locally on port 9411 but you can change these
values under the `kamon.prometheus` and `kamon.zipkin` configuration keys, respectively.


#### Metrics

All you need to do is [configure a scrape configuration in Prometheus][3]. The following snippet is a minimal
example that should work with the minimal server from the previous section.

```yaml
A minimal Prometheus configuration snippet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kamon-prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9095']
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Once you configure this target in Prometheus you are ready to run some queries like this:

<img class="img-fluid" src="/doc/img/http4smetrics.png">

Those are the `Server Metrics` metrics that we are gathering by default:

* __active-requests__: The the number active requests.
* __http-responses__: Response time by status code.
* __abnormal-termination__: The number of abnormal requests termination.
* __service-errors__: The number of service errors.
* __headers-times__: The number of abnormal requests termination.
* __http-request__: Request time by status code.

Now you can go ahead, make your custom metrics and create your own dashboards!

#### Traces

Assuming that you have a Zipkin instance running locally with the default ports, you can go to <http://localhost:9411>
and start investigating traces for this application. Once you find a trace you are interested in you will see something
like this:

<img class="img-fluid" src="/doc/img/traces.png">

Clicking on a span will bring up a details view where you can see all tags for the selected span:

### Enjoy!

That's it, you are now collecting metrics and tracing information from a [http4s][4] application.
